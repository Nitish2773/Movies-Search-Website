## Project Overview

The **Movies Search Website** is a dynamic single-page application (SPA) built using **React.js** and **Node.js**, providing users with a seamless and interactive platform to search for movies. This project integrates the **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** to fetch real-time movie data, allowing users to explore various movies, view detailed information, and filter results based on different criteria.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Movie Search:**
  - Search for movies by title with real-time suggestions and autocomplete, improving the user experience and helping users quickly find movies.
  
- **Pagination:**
  - Efficiently manages large sets of search results with pagination, allowing users to easily navigate through pages of movies.
  
- **Sorting and Filtering:**
  - Sort results by release date, rating, or other relevant criteria. Filter movies based on genres, release year, and other attributes for a more tailored search.

- **Movie Details:**
  - Clicking on a movie title shows detailed information including a synopsis, cast, release date, and rating, providing a comprehensive view of the selected movie.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The application adapts to different screen sizes, offering an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **API Integration:**
  - Fetches movie data from **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API, providing up-to-date and comprehensive movie information.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js**: Used for building the user interface, offering a dynamic and responsive experience.
  
- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js**: Handles API requests, managing server-side logic for fetching and processing data.
  
- **API Integration:**
  - **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**: Provides movie-related data including movie titles, details, ratings, and more.

- **Styling:**
  - **CSS**: Custom styling ensures the app is visually appealing and fully responsive across all devices.

## How It Works

1. **Search Functionality:**
   - The user types a movie title in the search bar, and the app queries the **TMDb API** to retrieve a list of matching movies.
   
2. **Displaying Results:**
   - The results are displayed in a paginated format, showing movie titles and basic information. Pagination allows users to browse through multiple pages of search results.

3. **Movie Details:**
   - Users can click on any movie title to view detailed information such as a movie synopsis, cast, release date, and user ratings.

4. **Sorting & Filtering:**
   - The app enables users to sort the search results based on various criteria (e.g., release date, rating) and filter by genres to refine the results.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movies-search-website.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd movies-search-website
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up your API key:**
   - Create a `.env` file and add your TMDb API key:
     ```
     REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your-api-key
     ```
5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Your application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This project is a demonstration of building a fully functional movie search platform using modern web technologies. It combines the power of React.js for a dynamic frontend with Node.js for handling backend logic and API requests. With features like pagination, filtering, and real-time search, users can have a smooth experience exploring and discovering movies.
